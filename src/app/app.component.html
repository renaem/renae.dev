                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">Taking Certified Occupational Safety Specialist (COSS) training early on allowed me to gain new personal understanding of the concerns of a safety professional. This training not only fundamentally influenced my design perspective, but also supported me to speak knowledgeably while consulting our primary users: industrial safety professionals.</p>
                    <p>My work has included several large projects such as a major software 2.0 redesign, design system implementation, new feature development, feature redesigns, mobile app design, reporting, data visualization, brand materials, and more.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I actively participate as a full stack designer / product engineer: defining technical requirements and leading front-end development on our software team; seeing every project through from conception to iteration to completion and beyond.</p>

I executed the logotype, brand direction, teaser website, social media, and initial product design for this fashion-forward startup. The brand won Best in Category for Identity Mark at the 2021 Art Director’s Association of Iowa Awards and received an additional Award of Excellence for the brand system.

                <p>A successful Kickstarter project involving a redesign of a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) platform called GMBinder. The site features “homebrew” content: material written by users from all over the world, intended to be used as the setting and story for tabletop role playing games—the most popular of which being DnD. These documents are authored using Markdown and processed on-the-fly into beautifully formatted documents. I not only revamped the UI, but created custom illustrations and textures for a new document theme and other promotional Kickstarter materials.</p>
