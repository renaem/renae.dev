                As Lead Product Designer for <a href="https://makusafe.com" target="_blank">M<span class="diacritic orange">a</span>kuSafe</a>, I design software for a unique problem space: hazard detection in industrial workplaces.
            </p>
            <p>M<span class="diacritic">a</span>kuSafe provides an innovative hardware ecosystem consisting of base station kiosks, wearable devices, and of courseâ€”M<span class="diacritic">a</span>kuSmart, the supporting cloud data & analytics platform.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0;">Taking Certified Occupational Safety Specialist (COSS) training allowed me to gain new personal understanding of the concerns of a safety professional. This training not only fundamentally influenced my design perspective, but also supported me to speak knowledgeably with our primary users, industrial safety professionals.</p>
                <p>My work has included several large projects such as a major overall 2.0 redesign, design system implementation, new feature development, feature redesigns, mobile app design, reporting, data visualization, brand materials, and more.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I actively participate as a full stack designer: defining technical requirements and leading front-end development on our software team.</p>
